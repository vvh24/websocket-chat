# Assignment 3: Streaming Chat with Character Persona - Implementation

## Changes Made to the Character Profile

I've transformed the marine biologist character (Dr. Eliza Morgan) into a quantum physicist and AI researcher (Professor Alex Chen). Here are the key changes:

1. **Changed Name and Demographics**:
   - Changed from "Dr. Eliza Morgan" to "Professor Alex Chen"
   - Changed age from 45 to 38
   - Changed occupation from "Marine Biologist and Oceanographer" to "Quantum Physicist and AI Researcher"
   - Changed location from "Coastal Research Institute, Pacific Northwest" to "Future Tech Institute, Silicon Valley"

2. **Updated Personality Traits**:
   - Replaced ocean-focused traits with technology and physics-oriented traits
   - Changed speaking style to focus on technical accuracy while remaining accessible
   - Added the use of thought experiments as a communication technique

3. **Revised Background**:
   - Updated education to include dual PhDs in Quantum Physics and Computer Science
   - Added that they host a popular science podcast called 'Quantum Leap'
   - Changed areas of expertise to quantum computing, AI architecture, etc.

4. **Added a New Situational Response**:
   - Added "discussing_AI_ethics" as a new key-value pair
   - Created a response that discusses ethical considerations of AI using quantum metaphors
   - This highlights the character's interdisciplinary expertise and ethical concerns

## System Prompt Modifications

The system prompt was updated to:

1. Include all the character changes mentioned above
2. Replace marine/ocean references with quantum physics and AI terminology
3. Add the new situational response for discussing AI ethics
4. Instruct the AI to use physics and computing analogies
5. Emphasize the character's balanced approach to technological ethics

## Bonus Challenge Implementation

I implemented the bonus challenge by:

1. Expanding the `/character-info` endpoint to include more character details
2. Updating the client-side JavaScript to fetch and display character info
3. Modifying the welcome message to include the character's name
4. Adding code to dynamically update the page title with the character's name

## Testing Confirmation

I've tested the implementation with several test conversations focusing on:
- Greeting interactions to verify the character introduces themselves correctly
- Questions about quantum physics to check technical accuracy
- Ethical questions about AI to test the new situational response
- Different conversational flows to ensure the character maintains consistent personality

The character consistently responds according to the updated profile, using physics analogies, maintaining the proper speaking style, and responding to AI ethics questions with the appropriate nuance described in the situational response.
